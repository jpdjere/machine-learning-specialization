## 1 - Packages 

First, let's run the cell below to import all the packages that you will need during this assignment.
- [numpy](www.numpy.org) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is a famous library to plot graphs in Python.
-  ``utils.py`` contains helper functions for this assignment. You do not need to modify code in this file.

## 2 - Logistic Regression

In this part of the exercise, you will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.

<a name="2.1"></a>
### 2.1 Problem Statement

Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant‚Äôs chance of admission based on their results on two exams. 
* You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. 
* For each training example, you have the applicant‚Äôs scores on two exams and the admissions decision. 
* Your task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant‚Äôs probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams. 

<a name="2.2"></a>
### 2.2 Loading and visualizing the data

You will start by loading the dataset for this task. 
- The `load_dataset()` function shown below loads the data into variables `X_train` and `y_train`
  - `X_train` contains exam scores on two exams for a student
  - `y_train` is the admission decision 
      - `y_train = 1` if the student was admitted 
      - `y_train = 0` if the student was not admitted 
  - Both `X_train` and `y_train` are numpy arrays.

```py
# load dataset
X_train, y_train = load_data("data/ex2data1.txt")
```

#### View the variables
Let's get more familiar with your dataset.  
- A good place to start is to just print out each variable and see what it contains.

The code below prints the first five values of `X_train` and the type of the variable.

```py
print("First five elements in X_train are:\n", X_train[:5])
print("Type of X_train:",type(X_train))

# First five elements in X_train are:
#  [[34.62365962 78.02469282]
#  [30.28671077 43.89499752]
#  [35.84740877 72.90219803]
#  [60.18259939 86.3085521 ]
#  [79.03273605 75.34437644]]
# Type of X_train: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>

```
Now print the first five values of `y_train`:
```py
print("First five elements in y_train are:\n", y_train[:5])
print("Type of y_train:",type(y_train))
# First five elements in y_train are:
#  [0. 0. 0. 1. 1.]
# Type of y_train: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

#### Check the dimensions of your variables

Another useful way to get familiar with your data is to view its dimensions. Let's print the shape of `X_train` and `y_train` and see how many training examples we have in our dataset.

```py
print ('The shape of X_train is: ' + str(X_train.shape))
print ('The shape of y_train is: ' + str(y_train.shape))
print ('We have m = %d training examples' % (len(y_train)))

# The shape of X_train is: (100, 2)
# The shape of y_train is: (100,)
# We have m = 100 training examples
```

#### Visualize your data

Before starting to implement any learning algorithm, it is always good to visualize the data if possible.
- The code below displays the data on a 2D plot (as shown below), where the axes are the two exam scores, and the positive and negative examples are shown with different markers.
- We use a helper function in the ``utils.py`` file to generate this plot.

![](./img/2024-01-12-12-49-01.png)

```py
# Plot examples
plot_data(X_train, y_train[:], pos_label="Admitted", neg_label="Not admitted")

# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Exam 2 score') 
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Exam 1 score') 
plt.legend(loc="upper right")
plt.show()
```

Your goal is to build a logistic regression model to fit this data.
- With this model, you can then predict if a new student will be admitted based on their scores on the two exams.

### 2.3  Sigmoid function

Recall that for logistic regression, the model is represented as

$$ f_{\mathbf{w},b}(x) = g(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x} + b)$$
where function $g$ is the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function is defined as:

$$g(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$

Let's implement the sigmoid function first, so it can be used by the rest of this assignment.

<a name='ex-01'></a>
### Exercise 1
Please complete  the `sigmoid` function to calculate

$$g(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$

Note that 
- `z` is not always a single number, but can also be an array of numbers. 
- If the input is an array of numbers, we'd like to apply the sigmoid function to each value in the input array.

```py
def sigmoid(z):
    """
    Compute the sigmoid of z

    Args:
        z (ndarray): A scalar, numpy array of any size.

    Returns:
        g (ndarray): sigmoid(z), with the same shape as z
         
    """
          
    ### START CODE HERE ###
    
    g = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))
    
    ### END SOLUTION ###  
    
    return g
```

When you are finished, try testing a few values by calling `sigmoid(x)` in the cell below. 
- For large positive values of x, the sigmoid should be close to 1, while for large negative values, the sigmoid should be close to 0. 
- Evaluating `sigmoid(0)` should give you exactly 0.5. 

```py
# Note: You can edit this value
value = np.array([0, 5.4, -1, 1, 1000])

print (f"sigmoid({value}) = {sigmoid(value)}")

# sigmoid([   0.     5.4   -1.     1.  1000. ]) 
#         = [0.5        0.99550373 0.26894142 0.73105858 1.        ]

```

### 2.4 Cost function for logistic regression

In this section, you will implement the cost function for logistic regression.

<a name='ex-02'></a>
### Exercise 2

Please complete the `compute_cost` function using the equations below.

Recall that for logistic regression, the cost function is of the form 

$$ J(\mathbf{w},b) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \left[ loss(f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), y^{(i)}) \right] \tag{1}$$

where
* m is the number of training examples in the dataset


* $loss(f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), y^{(i)})$ is the cost for a single data point, which is - 

    $$loss(f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), y^{(i)}) = (-y^{(i)} \log\left(f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right) - \left( 1 - y^{(i)}\right) \log \left( 1 - f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right) \tag{2}$$
    
    
*  $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$ is the model's prediction, while $y^{(i)}$, which is the actual label

*  $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = g(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x^{(i)}} + b)$ where function $g$ is the sigmoid function.
    * It might be helpful to first calculate an intermediate variable $z_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x^{(i)}} + b = w_0x^{(i)}_0 + ... + w_{n-1}x^{(i)}_{n-1} + b$ where $n$ is the number of features, before calculating $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = g(z_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}))$

Note:
* As you are doing this, remember that the variables `X_train` and `y_train` are not scalar values but matrices of shape ($m, n$) and ($ùëö$,1) respectively, where  $ùëõ$ is the number of features and $ùëö$ is the number of training examples.
* You can use the sigmoid function that you implemented above for this part.

If you get stuck, you can check out the hints presented after the cell below to help you with the implementation.
